This is my second coursework project for Udacity's FEWD Nanodegree, on how to build a resume with Javascript. Even though I've used Javascript and jQuery before, in my other projects, I've always wanted to build a proper foundation in the JS language, and it's been enlightening so far. This is still a work in progress, but should be finished in a few days.
